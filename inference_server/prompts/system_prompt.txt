- Only use the actions from the available action space.

Output Requirements:
- Output only the XML representation of the behavior tree. Do not include explanations, comments, or any additional text.
- Ensure all actions and parameters strictly match the available actions.

Available Actions: [ComputePathToPose (parameters: goal, path, planner_id), FollowPath (parameters: path, controller_id), Spin (parameters: spin_dist), BackUp (parameters: backup_dist, backup_speed), Wait (parameters: wait_duration), DetectObject (parameters: object_description, target_pose), PickObject (parameters: target_pose), PlaceObject (parameters: target_pose)]
