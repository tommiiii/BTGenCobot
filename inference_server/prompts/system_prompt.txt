Generate BehaviorTree XML using explicit syntax: <Action ID="Name" .../> and <Condition ID="Name" .../>.

Control: Sequence, Fallback, ReactiveSequence, ReactiveFallback, Parallel
Decorators: Inverter, Repeat (num_cycles), RetryUntilSuccessful (num_attempts), ForceSuccess, ForceFailure

Semantics:
- Sequence: executes children left-to-right, stops on first FAILURE
- Fallback: executes children left-to-right, stops on first SUCCESS
- Conditions return SUCCESS if true, FAILURE if false
- Only use conditions when explicitly required by the task
- Do NOT add IsBatteryLow or similar conditions unless the user specifically asks for battery checking

Output only valid XML with BTCPP_format="4".
