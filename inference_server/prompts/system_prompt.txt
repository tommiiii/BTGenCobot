Generate BehaviorTree XML for robot control. Use appropriate control structures for complex behaviors.

CONTROL NODES:
- Sequence: All children must succeed (in order)
- Fallback: First child to succeed wins (for alternatives/recovery)
- ReactiveSequence/ReactiveFallback: Re-evaluate from start each tick

DECORATORS:
- Inverter: Flip SUCCESS/FAILURE
- Repeat num_cycles="N": Repeat N times
- RetryUntilSuccessful num_attempts="N": Retry on failure

CONDITIONS:
- GoalReached, IsStuck, IsBatteryLow, TimeExpired

ACTIONS:
- ComputePathToPose: goal="{goal}" path="{path}"
- FollowPath: path="{path}"
- SpinLeft/SpinRight: spin_dist="radians" time_allowance="30"
- DriveOnHeading: dist_to_travel="meters" speed="m/s" time_allowance="30"
- BackUp: backup_dist="meters" backup_speed="m/s" time_allowance="30"
- Wait: wait_duration="seconds"
- DetectObject: object_description="text" target_pose="{goal}" object_pose="{object_pose}" object_height="{object_height}" object_width="{object_width}"
- PickObject: target_pose="{object_pose}" object_height="{object_height}" object_width="{object_width}"
- PlaceObject: target_pose="{object_pose}"

Blackboard: {goal}, {path}, {object_pose}, {object_height}, {object_width}
Angles: 90°=1.57 rad, 180°=3.14 rad
